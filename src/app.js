 * # Quick Start
 *
 * Run the following commands to install:
 *
 * ```shell
 * npm install
 * bower install
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 *     If you are unfamiliar with **Node.js**, **Grunt**, or **Bower** tools *or* have not installed them on your computer,
 *     read through the instructions in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.
 * </div>
 *
 * # Getting Started
 *
 * This package requires[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - an application platform which many development and automation tools may be run.
 * Download [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) and install it on your computer.
 *
 * > The **Node.js** platform is used to run development tools such as [Grunt](#getting-started_install-grunt) and [Bower](#getting-started_install-bower)
 *
 * Once `Node.js` is installed, use the `npm` (node package manager) command to install this project's node dependencies:
 *
 * ```shell
 * npm install
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 *     When the [npm install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) command is run without a package (e.g., `npm install <package_name>`),
 *     it installs dependencies listed in the `package.json` file (located in the root directory of this project).
 * </div>
 *
 *
 * ## Install Grunt
 * *This package requires Grunt `~0.4.5`*
 *
 * If you have not already installed `Grunt` on your computer, use the following command to install the `Grunt Command Line Interface (grunt-cli)`:
 *
 * ```shell
 * npm install -g grunt-cli
 * ```
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 *     The **-g** option installs `grunt-cli` globally on you computer. You only need to run this command once.
 * </div>
 *
 * > If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide,
 * > as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.
 *
 *
 * ## Install Bower
 *
 * If `Bower` is not globally installed on your computer, run the following command:
 *
 * ```shell
 * npm install -g bower
 * ```
 *
 * [Bower](http://bower.io/) is also a package manager for front-end web frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, and Bootstrap.
 * This project uses Bower to manage front-end third-party and peer dependencies.
 *
 * Once installed, you can download this project's `Bower` dependencies with the following command:
 *
 * ```shell
 * bower install
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 *     Similar to `npm install` if `Bower's install` command is not given a package name (e.g., `bower install <package_name>`), it will install
 *     dependencies listed in the `bower.json` config file.
 * </div>
